Pre-requisites:
- Java environment
How to run:
1. Clone the repository using "git clone https://github.com/TeresaVu/enterprise-db-assignment.git"
2. Run Main.java
The main code calls each function of the database, following the examples in Figure 2 of the assignment page. Data is added and retrieved from the database, with errors being thrown if not currently in transaction or data has not been commited yet.

Assignment feedback:
The link provided in the resources of this assignment (https://medium.com/@mithoonkumar/design-an-in-memory-nosql-database-ood-428d48b68dfa) is helpful, but I think it makes the implementation more complex than it needs to be, unless that complexity is expected. The assignment should specify the name for the database implementation instead of making it seem like it can be named anything. This could make it easier to set up automatic testing and grade everyone's code.
